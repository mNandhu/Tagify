"""SQLite engine lifecycle + connection helpers (async app + sync scanner).

Replaces the old Mongo ``motor.py`` / ``mongo.py`` wrappers. One SQLite file backs
both engines; WAL mode lets readers proceed during a write.

**Writer discipline (invariant).** SQLite is single-writer. The *actual* serializer
across the async app and the sync scanner threads is SQLite's own file lock +
``busy_timeout`` — not the Python locks here. The :func:`write_lock` /
:func:`sync_write_lock` helpers only prevent self-contention *within* each side; the
real rule is **keep scanner write-transactions small and commit often** so no
transaction holds the file lock long enough to exhaust ``busy_timeout`` and surface
``database is locked`` to an app write.
