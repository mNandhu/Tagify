"""The scan's batched transactional writer.

A ``ScanWriter`` accumulates indexed image rows (and their optional raw-gen rows)
and commits them in batches of ``batch_size`` through a caller-supplied ``commit``
sink, then flushes the remainder at the end. Pulling this out of the scan closure
gives the batch accounting a direct test surface — the exact place scan bugs hide:
the last partial batch never flushed, buffers cleared before a failed commit, the
``indexed`` count drifting from what was actually written.

The ``commit`` sink owns the I/O (transaction + retry); ``ScanWriter`` owns only
the accumulate / flush-every-N / flush-remainder accounting, so it can be tested
with a list of fake rows and a counting sink — no DB, no threads.
