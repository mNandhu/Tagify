"""Bounded-concurrency worker loop, lifted out of the scan closure.

``run_pool`` runs ``work`` over ``items`` with at most ``max_workers`` threads and
at most ``max_pending`` futures in flight at once (so a huge library doesn't
balloon memory by submitting everything up front). It calls ``on_complete`` once
per finished item, in completion order, with either the result or the exception
that ``work`` raised. Between waves it consults ``is_cancelled``; on cancel it
cancels the not-yet-started futures and stops, returning ``False``.

This is the part of scanning that is fiddly to get right (prime / wait / refill /
cancel) but trivial to test: hand it a list, a fake ``work``, and a cancel flag.
The domain decisions — what a result means, when to flush — stay with the caller
via ``on_complete``.
